Key Features :
1. React Router: Implemented React Router to enable smooth navigation and provide a seamless user experience when interacting with different utility functions.

2. useState Hooks: Leveraged the power of useState hooks to efficiently manage and update component states, allowing for dynamic content rendering based on user input.

3. Light/Dark Mode Functionality: Utilized the useState hook to implement a light/dark mode toggle, enabling users to switch between two visually appealing themes based on their preference.

Usage
TextUtils offers the following utility functions on user input text:

1. Typing Speed (WPM): Measures how many words a user can type in one minute, helping improve typing skills.

2. Word Count: Counts the number of words in the provided text, giving a quick overview of the text length.

3. Uppercase and Lowercase Conversion: Allows users to easily convert text to uppercase or lowercase as needed.
